    "Problem Statement\n",
    "    \n",
    "This study was designed to determine the relationship between the Point-in-Time (PIT) homeless count and the Housing Inventory Count (HIC). I want to understand;\n",
    "* What impact does the HIC have on overall homelessness.\n",
    "* Which populations are most influenced by the current sheltering options.\n",
    "* Which communities (cities, towns, counties, states) are most at risk of homelessness. \n",
    "\n",
    "Context Each year, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) releases an annual report to Congress estimating total homelessness. As homeless counts continue to rise so does its funding. But why? Why do we continue to spend if lack of funding isn't the root cause? I try to understand this dilemma by evaluating the most fundamental need for the homeless, shelter. Using the HIC I plan to determine the efficiency in which the current service available are being rendered. \n"
